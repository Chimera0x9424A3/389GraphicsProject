Questions to answer for this week:  
a. What is the theme of your museum:  
    H.R. Geiger (for wall art) and BigRed for the model  
    Maybe an Alien egg pod or something instead if we have the time  
b. How many rooms will your museum have:  
    one main one with subdivisions/internal walls (check museum model)  
c. Have you started looking for textures for your museum walls/floors? If so, what are your plans:  
    Have a couple possiblities for floor and ceiling: stone/metal mix  
    Check textures folder for more info  
d. Will your museum have a ceiling:   
    Yes. Flat for part of it and dome for the middle (check museum model)  
e. You must have at least ONE “sculpture” in your museum. What are you planning to use for
 your sculpture(s):  
    BigRed model from the cover of the algorithms book  
    We currently have a simplified version in our Models folder
    Might switch to Xenomorph model if we have time  
f. You must have at least FOUR “paintings” in your museum. What were you planning to use for  
 your pictures? Have you already started looking for textures that can be applied as “pictures”?  
 Will your pictures be hung on the wall? Will they be murals? Do you have a completely different  
 idea of how these paintings will be added to your museum:
    All paintings/art of H. R. Geiger  
    Some hung on walls, possibly some murals as well, depending on size  
    Check wall art folder for more details

Some models are loading!!!  
Cube and other simple object  
Can toggle between two different models and display modes (wireframe/filled in)  
  Check ToggleTime.cpp  
Next step: maybe change the viewpoint?
